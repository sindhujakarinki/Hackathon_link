Hand gesture recognition is an essential component of human-computer interaction systems, enabling users to interact with computers and devices through intuitive hand movements. This abstract presents a study on hand gesture recognition using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. The objective of this research is to develop a robust and real-time hand gesture recognition system that can accurately interpret hand movements and classify them into predefined gesture categories.
The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV. The system achieves high accuracy in real-time gesture recognition, making it suitable for applications such as sign language interpretation, human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and gaming.
